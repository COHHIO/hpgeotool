# Emergency Rental Assistance/Prevention Prioritization Tool

This tool was created and will be maintained by the COHHIO HMIS team based on the work graciously shared by the Urban Institute. Please find their work [here](https://www.urban.org/features/where-prioritize-emergency-rental-assistance-keep-renters-their-homes) and the data and data dictionary [here](https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/rental-assistance-priority-index).

The purpose of this Shiny app is to make this research easy to use by case managers who have an address and the need to find a household's percentile, as compared to their state. Type the household's address into the text field, click Submit, and then the housing, covid-19, and equity indices along with a total index will display.
